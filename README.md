This authentication system has been built an an introduction to object oriented programming, and allows easy integration into any project. With lots of helper classes, the majority of functionality from this code can be re-used elsewhere, such as the PDO database wrapper.

It also features static helper classes to work with input, sessions, cookies, validation, configuration and a full PDO database wrapper.

With this system, users can register, log in, choose an option to be remembered, update their profile information which can be publicly viewed, change their password and log out. Each user can also be part of a specific permissions group, allowing you to give fine grained control over permissions your users have within your application.

All code is free to be used on any project.
